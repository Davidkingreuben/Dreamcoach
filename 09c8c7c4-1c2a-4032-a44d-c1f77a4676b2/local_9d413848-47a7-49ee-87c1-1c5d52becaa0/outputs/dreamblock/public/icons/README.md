# App Icons

Place your app icons here:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 PNG icon for PWA (home screen, maskable)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 PNG icon for PWA (splash screen, maskable)

These are referenced in `manifest.json` and should have transparent backgrounds with rounded corners optimized for masking.

For quick placeholder generation, you can use:
- https://www.pwa-builder.com/
- https://favicon.io/
- https://appicon.co/

Recommended: Design a simple geometric icon in your brand colors (#E8E8F0 on #080810).
