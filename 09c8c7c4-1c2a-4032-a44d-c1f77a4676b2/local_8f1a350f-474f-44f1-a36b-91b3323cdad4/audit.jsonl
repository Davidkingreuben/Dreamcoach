The core purpose is to help users: Understand why they haven’t done it Distinguish between psychological resistance vs real-world limitations Decide whether the dream is viable, misaligned, symbolic, or unrealistic Either take grounded first steps OR consciously reshape or release the dream without shame CORE PHILOSOPHY People don’t fail to act only because of laziness. They get stuck due to: Fear (judgment, failure, success, visibility) Perfectionism Identity conflict (“who am I to do this?”) Overwhelm Shame or emotional associations Competing priorities Time, physical, or life-stage constraints Fantasy thinking vs realistic feasibility This app must respect reality. It must NOT push toxic “you can do anything” motivation. Truth and clarity are the goal — not hype. PRIMARY USER FLOW 1. Dream Intake User enters: Dream title (free text) Category (music, podcast, art, business, athletic, lifestyle, other) How long they’ve wanted it (years or date) Importance (1–10) Pain of not doing it (1–10) Fear of doing it (1–10) Display “days / years delayed” compassionately (not as shame). 2. Resistance Interview (Psychological Layer) Ask structured, selectable questions: What emotion comes up when you think about doing this? (fear, shame, overwhelm, boredom, excitement-then-crash, numbness) What thought appears first? (not good enough, people will judge, don’t know where to start, too late, won’t matter) Where do you get stuck? (starting, consistency, finishing, publishing, promoting, committing) What are you protecting by not doing this? (comfort, identity, relationships, control, certainty) If success were guaranteed, would you still hesitate? (yes/no + why) From these answers, classify the user into Resistance Archetypes (can be rule-based): Fear of Visibility Perfectionist Freeze Overwhelm Fog Identity Conflict Fear of Success Shame Loop Consistency Collapse Misalignment / False Want Also assign a Stuck Phase: Spark → Preparation → First-Step Resistance → Momentum → Pre-Publish Panic → Dormancy → Return 3. Reality & Feasibility Check (CRITICAL) The app must explicitly test realism. Ask: Are there physical or biological constraints relevant to this dream? Do you realistically have the time required in your current life? What would need to be sacrificed to pursue this seriously? Does this conflict with existing responsibilities? How many years of focused effort would this realistically take? Are you willing to commit to that timeline? Add a Fantasy vs Essence Test: What part of this dream do you actually want? (status, identity, process, meaning) If the external reward disappeared, would you still want it? 4. Dream Classification Output Based on resistance + reality, classify the dream into ONE of four states: Viable & Aligned (pursue now) Viable but Misaligned (right dream, wrong season) Symbolic / Transformable (reshape into a realistic version) Unrealistic in current form (consciously release or radically redefine) This classification must be honest but compassionate. 5. Decision & Action Engine If Pursue Now: Generate 3–5 emotionally intelligent micro-steps (5–30 min) Steps must be tailored to the user’s Resistance Archetype and constraints If Reshape: Translate fantasy into essence (e.g. “famous musician” → “consistent creative output”) Suggest a smaller, grounded version of the dream If Defer: Allow user to archive the dream with a future review date Frame as a conscious choice, not failure If Release: Guide a short “closure reflection” so the dream doesn’t linger as guilt CHECK-INS & PATTERN TRACKING Instead of “Did you complete your task?”, ask: What did you avoid today? Where did resistance show up? What emotion was strongest? What tiny step feels possible? Track over time: Most common stuck point Most common emotion Repeating resistance archetype Dreams repeatedly abandoned vs consciously released Generate a Personal Resistance Profile: Example: “Your main block is fear of visibility. Avoidance spikes at publishing.” DESIGN & TONE Minimal, calm, serious Supportive but direct No hustle language No shame No therapy diagnosis This app should feel like: “A place where I finally tell the truth about what I’m avoiding.” TECH CONSTRAINTS iOS-first (SwiftUI or cross-platform) Simple backend (Firebase/Supabase) Rule-based logic first (AI optional later) Admin-editable question bank and step library NON-GOALS This is NOT a habit tracker NOT a generic AI advice chatbot NOT motivational hype Success means the user leaves knowing whether they are blocked, misaligned, unrealistic — or ready — and what to do next. this is a initial system / project prompt : Generate the core screens and data models” * “Now generate the Resistance Archetype logic” * “Now design the onboarding UI” * “Now simplify this into an MVP”"},"_audit_timestamp":"2026-02-25T18:06:50.325Z"}
