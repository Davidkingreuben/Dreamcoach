    "You've been building this in your mind. What scares you isn't failing — it's being seen in the act of trying. Visibility feels like exposure, not expression. So you protect yourself by not starting. The work stays safe in the imagined version, where no one can judge it — and neither can you.",
  "Perfectionist Freeze":
    "The standard keeps moving. Every time you get close, the bar rises. That's not ambition — it's a delay mechanism wearing ambition's clothes. Perfectionism isn't about quality; it's about never having to find out. The bar can't be met because the bar isn't real.",
  "Overwhelm Fog":
    "You're trying to solve a three-year problem in a single mental session. The whole mountain is visible from the bottom, and it's paralyzing. The scope isn't the problem — trying to hold all of it at once is. You don't need the full map. You need the next ten meters.",
  "Identity Conflict":
    "Part of you doesn't believe you're the kind of person who actually does this. You're waiting to become someone else before you start — but the identity comes after the action, not before. No one wakes up as a musician. They wake up and practice.",
  "Fear of Success":
    "Even with success guaranteed, you'd still hesitate. That's not fear of failing — that's fear of what would change if this worked. Who you'd have to become. What you'd have to give up. What people would expect. Failing is safe because it changes nothing.",
  "Shame Loop":
    "Something happened before — a past attempt, early criticism, a comparison that stuck — and it became evidence. You've been treating one painful moment as a permanent verdict. It isn't. One data point is not a pattern. One chapter is not the book.",
  "Consistency Collapse":
    "You can start. That's not your problem. The problem is the system around starting — or the absence of one. Motivation gets you to the door. It doesn't keep you walking. You've been treating consistency as a character trait when it's actually a design problem.",
  "Misalignment":
    "Part of what you want isn't the dream itself — it's what the dream would say about you. That's not a flaw; most desires have this layer. But when the identity payoff is the main driver, the daily work feels hollow. Worth asking: what do you actually want to be doing on a Tuesday afternoon?",
